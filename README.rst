SPI NOR Tests 2025 Q3
=====================

- Overview -

This tiny project is planned to capture the needed details to connect a JEDEC complient, SPI NOR flash device to an NXP LPC55S69-EVK dev board.  Firmware choice is a Zephyr RTOS sample app.  As a first step a device tree overlay is needed to enable a SPI connected peripheral on the EVK board.
